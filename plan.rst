Attendees
=========

Many Bermudians are living abroad.  And many residents have strong
ties to other parts of the world.


Date
====

March break
-----------

Or any time when Bermudians in education can get back to
the island.

Should also be an easier time for others in academia to visit.

Internationalisation
====================

Bermuda has a strong Portuguese community as well as its own
distintictive flavour of English.

Bermuda also has residents from all over the world.

The `sphinx`_ system that I am using here supports translations, so if
anyone is interested in helping with translation that would be good.

Workshops
=========

PyData conferences typically start with a day of tutorials and
workshops.

Many of these are excellent introductions to python and the tools that
people are using for data science.

This could be invaluable and there will likely be many residents
interested in attending.  

It would be good to have some attendees who can help run workshops.


Projects
========

There are many small projects that people could work on over the next
few months, that would make good subject to present at a conference.
