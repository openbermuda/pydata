March break
-----------

Or any time when Bermudians in education can get back to
the island.

Should also be an easier time for others in academia to visit.

Internationalisation
====================

Bermuda has a strong Portuguese community as well as its own
distintictive flavour of English.

Bermuda also has residents from all over the world.

The `sphinx`_ system that I am using here supports translations, so if
anyone is interested in helping with translation that would be good.
